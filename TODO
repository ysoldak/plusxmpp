Feel free to fork and try to implement these features and fixes

TODO
- sending xhtml formated messages
- implement alternative posts fetcher based on G+ API (they have restrictions, but this can be more efficient)
-- theoretically this enables us to fetch non-public posts (OAuth needed for this also)
- "show comments" command
- user's time zone support for post timestamps (can be automatic using xmpp or ask user to define tz?)
- making +1, posting comments and new posts (authentication will be requred, OAuth?)
- improve performance (now it takes ~7sec total time, ~2sec cpu to fetch for 37 plus ids)
-- http request is slow?
-- json parsing is slow?
-- disable debug helps?

FIXME
- repeats messages sometimes (timestamp comparison problem?) -- hope this is fixed now, will monitor and remove this line if really fixed.
